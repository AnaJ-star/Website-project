<p> Did you know that more than 7.6 million indiviuals suffer from some sort of heart disease in the UK- which in some severe cases leads to death? Cardiovascular diseases have been a life threat since mid 1960s, and unfortunately for some type, we still don't have a cure for it. We can just try our hardest to avoid it. It is rather common in elederly people, but it can also affect younger folks, including newborns. Therefore, this website is merely designed to educate people about the causes and ways to prevent these diseases, and who knows it may even save you!
