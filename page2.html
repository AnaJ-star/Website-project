<p> Unbelievably, heart diseses do not have any crystal clear causes. However, there are some factors that eventually lead to these diseases. In the medical world, there are know as "Risk factors". A fair few are listed below:</p>
<u>
	<li>High blood pressure AKA hypertension is the most typical risk fator. It makes the heart work much harder to pump blood, then eventually it restricts the blood flow to the heart. This then leads to terrible chest pains (which is called "Angina" in medical terms). Afterwards, it turns into a type of heart disease; Coronary heart disease.</li>
	<li>Having high cholestrol levels can also lead to heart diseases- alongdside with other health problems. The fatty deposits enter the blood vessels- restricting the blood flow to the heart.</li> 
	<li>Diabetes restrict the bloow flow as well. The excess sugar damages the blood vessels and develops fatty deposits in them.</li>
	<li>Smoking is the most- disease causing factors. It increases the risk of one growing blood clots in the vessels- which also restricts the blood flow.</li> 
	<li>Not taking good care of physical health .i.e not exercising enough also causes coronary heart diseases. Being inactive invites the growth of fatty deposists in the vessels- which then limits the blood flow.</li>
	<li>Medical diseases such as "Thrombosis" can also lead to heart diseases. This condition is caused by not being physically active- which leads in the formation of blood clots in the vessels.</li>
	<li>Family history of heart diseases increases your chances of developing cardiovascular heart diseases in future.</li>
